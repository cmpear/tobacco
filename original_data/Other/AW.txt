Caveats:
"1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision."
"2. Data for Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02198), Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02105), Skagway"
"Municipality, AK (FIPS code 02230), Petersburg Borough/Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02195) and Wrangell City and Borough, AK (FIPS"

"5. There is a discontinuity in the mortality and population data for Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area (FIPS code 02290) between 2002"
"and 2003. The discontinuity occurs because part of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area became Denali Borough, Alaska (FIPS code 02068) and"

"8. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"9. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
